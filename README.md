# Folding Phoroter App

An App that lets you know the refractive error of an eye.

 * Folding Phorotor is a paper foldable device that gives the refractive error of the human eye. More about the project [https://fellowsblog.ted.com/the-1-foldable-eye-screening-kit-is-here-1db4420e8ad1] [https://www.sandeepvempati.com/work#/folding-phoropter/]
 * It consists of two known power lenses.
 * We can get the desired powers by changing the distance between the lenses.
 * The device has marked a scale to get the refractive error.
 * This app gives the system effective power (when kept in front of an eye) based on the distance between those lenses.

* A study is conducted to validate the scale by taking the refractive errors (eye power) of the participants and their respective distance between the lenses to see the target.
* When we overlay the values of the study and the values from the mathematical equation we see 95% correlation.
