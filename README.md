# Folding Phoroter App

An App which lets you know the refractive error of an eye.

 * Folding Phorotor is a paper foldable device which gives the refractive error of human eye.
 * It consists of two known power lenses.
 * By chnaging the distance between the lenses we can get desired powers.
 * A scale has been marked on the device to get the refractive error.
 * This App gives the effective power of the system (when kept infront of an eye) based on the distance between those lenses.
